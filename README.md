# AI-Powered Identity Verification & Fraud Detection
**Intern Name:** Afjal Alam
**Batch:** 4

## Project Overview
This project uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) to verify identity documents like Aadhaar and PAN cards. It helps in detecting fraud automatically.

## My Contribution
I worked on two main parts of this project:

### 1. AI & Coding (See 'ocr_engine.py')
* I wrote the Python script to connect the OCR (Optical Character Recognition) engine.
* This code takes an image and extracts text from it for verification.

### 2. Documentation & Testing (See 'Documentation' folder)
* **Agile Planning:** I created the Sprint Backlog to plan the project tasks.
* **Quality Assurance (QA):** I created the "Unit Test Plan" to check for errors in the code.
* **Bug Tracking:** I maintained a "Defect Tracker" to list any issues found during testing.

## Tools Used
* Python (OpenCV, Pytesseract)
* Excel (For Agile & Test Planning)
